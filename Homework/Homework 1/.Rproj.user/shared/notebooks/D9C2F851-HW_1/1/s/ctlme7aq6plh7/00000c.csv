"0","#The box plot indicates that the median miles per gallon among vehicles is 22 mpg. The mean of 22.54 is slightly higher than the median of 22.00. Therefore, the data is skewed to the right, which may indicate several outliers with miles per gallon significantly above and below the median, and the data is not normally distributed.  "
